How We’ll Proceed
DAO Creation Flow (First Step)
Implement the DAO creation flow in Remix:
Form UI (Remix route/component)
On-chain transaction (using thirdweb or ethers, in the frontend)
On success, POST to a Remix action (backend route) to store off-chain data
Store in DB (or mock for now)
Redirect to dashboard
Subsequent Features
Proposals, voting, member management, etc., one by one.
Deployment
nginx config, certbot, domain, etc.
Next Step: DAO Creation Flow in Remix
Let’s start with the DAO creation flow, the Remix way:
1. Remix Route for DAO Creation
Create a file: Washika-dao-frontend/app/routes/dao.create.tsx
This will export a loader (if needed), an action (for POST), and a default component (the form).
2. Form UI
Use Remix <Form method="post"> for the DAO creation form.
3. On-Chain Transaction
In the form’s submit handler (client-side), trigger the blockchain transaction (using thirdweb/ethers).
On success, call fetch("/dao/create", { method: "post", ... }) with all form data + tx hash.
4. Remix Action
The action receives the POST, validates, and (for now) logs or stores the data.
