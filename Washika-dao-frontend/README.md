## ‚öôÔ∏è Vite Configuration (vite.config.js)

Vite requires minimal configuration, making it easy to set up and run your project.

1. **Install dependencies**: Run the command `npm i` to install and auto-configure dependencies as outlined in the `package.json` file:

2. **Start the development server**: Use the command `npm start` to start a development server with hot module replacement enabled by default:

3. **Access the application**: Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`. This will load the to access the frontend interface.
   
   
## ES6 Module Imports

Files are imported using ES6 syntax, keeping the code modular and organized.


## üß© Importing Components 
Components are stored in the ```src/components/``` directory and imported directly into the pages (or other components). This helps maintain a modular and reusable structure, improving maintainability.


## üé® Importing Styles and Fonts

Stylesheets ``(*.css)`` are located in the ```src/styles/``` directory.
Fonts are placed in the ```src/fonts/``` directory and are referenced within the CSS files.

This structure ensures separation of concerns between components, styles, and pages, making it easier to manage and scale the React application. 


The frontend interacts with the backend's API via HTTP requests to the defined routes.

Future iterations of the frontend will integrate with the backend's blockchain-based enhancements, including smart contract calls for specific actions.

## Current Fixes:

    1. UI Improvement: Enhanced CSS responsiveness for better user experience across different screen sizes and devices.
    
    2. API Integration: Implementation of more API calls to fetch data from the backend

## How to run the application: 
<h4> I will only provide the docker version since it is the only platform independent and most reliable form of maintaing different applications with their runtimes. 
</h4> 

## Docker commands 
<h5> First start by building the application & downloading its dependencies. 
</h5>
    1. <bold>docker build --build-arg VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID="api_key_sourced_from_thirdweb" -t wd-frontend .</bold>
<h5> Then run the application. </h5>
    2. <italic>docker run -p 8080:80 wd-frontend</italic>

## I hope you enjoy using the application as much as I enjoyed building it.

# üìò Product Documentation

## 1. Introduction & Vision
Washika DAO is a platform empowering community savings groups (Chamas, SACCOS, VICOBAs) with transparent, blockchain-based management. The vision is to provide accessible, secure, and user-friendly tools for group savings, lending, and governance, leveraging smart contracts and modern web technologies.

## 2. Technology Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, React Router V6
// TODO: Migrate to React Router V7, Remix Edition, the latest edition
- **Blockchain Integration:** Thirdweb SDK, ethers.js
- **Backend:** (Blackbox for this doc) ‚Äî handles API, business logic, and smart contract orchestration
- **Smart Contracts:** (Blackbox for this doc) ‚Äî deployed on Celo (testnet/mainnet)
- **Containerization:** Docker, Nginx
- **Deployment:** Coolify, Docker Compose

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend** communicates with the backend for data and with the blockchain via Thirdweb for wallet and contract interactions.
- **Backend** (future: will own all blockchain logic for consistency and security).
- **Smart Contracts** enforce DAO rules, multisig, and proposals on-chain.

## 3. Frontend/Backend/Smart Contract Integration
- **Current:**
  - Frontend directly interacts with smart contracts for wallet, DAO, and multisig actions.
  - Backend provides API for off-chain data and coordination.
- **Future:**
  - All blockchain logic (e.g., multisig, proposals) will be migrated to the backend for a more unitary, secure, and consistent experience.

## 4. Multisig Functionality: Current & Migration Plan
- **Current:**
  - Multisig contract functions are called directly from the frontend using Thirdweb.
  - Users sign transactions in-browser; contract state is updated on-chain, leading to faulty ux.
- **Migration Plan:**
  - Move multisig logic to backend endpoints (API), so the backend orchestrates contract calls and manages signatures.
  - Benefits: centralized error handling, better security, easier auditing, and a more consistent user experience.
  - Frontend will only call backend APIs, not the blockchain directly.

## 5. Migration Roadmap
### Phase 1: Migrate Blockchain Logic to Backend
- Move all contract interactions (starting with multisig) to backend endpoints.
- Use backend to aggregate, validate, and submit transactions.
- Frontend only calls backend APIs, use of standardized REST protocol improves overall architectural security.

### Phase 2: Adopt Remix (React Router Framework)
- Migrate frontend and backend to a unified Remix (React Router) app
- Enable SSR, improved routing, and easier deployment
- Refactor codebase for modularity and maintainability
- Add automated tests for new flows

### Phase 3: Streamline Deployment & Orchestration
- Use Docker Compose and Coolify for unified deployment.
- Automate CI/CD for Remix app.
- Document migration and handover process.

## 6. Libraries, Conventions, and Styles
- **React 18** for UI
- **Vite** for fast builds and HMR
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Thirdweb SDK** for blockchain/wallet integration
- **Ethers.js** for contract calls
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Vitest** for testing
- **Conventions:**
  - Modular components in `src/components/`
  - Hooks in `src/hooks/`
  - Utilities in `src/utils/`
  - Styles in `src/styles/`
  - Environment variables for secrets/config

## 7. Deployment & Operations
- **Build:** Docker multi-stage (Node 20+, Nginx)
- **Serve:** Nginx on port 80
- **Deploy:** Coolify or Docker Compose
- **Domains:** https://washikadao.xyz, https://www.washikadao.xyz
- **Environment:** Set `VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` for blockchain integration
- **Testing:** `npm test` (Vitest)

# üîë Thirdweb Smart Wallet Integration

## Overview
- The app uses [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) for seamless smart wallet and contract integration.
- Users can create an in-app wallet or connect an external wallet (e.g., MetaMask) via the Thirdweb ConnectButton.
- All blockchain interactions (DAO creation, proposals, multisig) are routed through the Thirdweb SDK.

## How It Works
1. **Client ID**: The app is configured with a `VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
2. **Wallet Modal**: Users connect or create a wallet using the Thirdweb ConnectButton (see `src/components/auth/ConnectWallet.tsx`).
3. **Chain Selection**: The app defaults to Celo Alfajores testnet, with a TODO to switch to mainnet for production.
4. **Smart Contract Calls**: All contract interactions use the Thirdweb SDK, which abstracts away RPC and wallet management.
5. **Account Abstraction**: The app can support account abstraction features (e.g., sponsored gas) via Thirdweb.

## Example (ConnectWallet.tsx)
```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { celoAlfajoresTestnet } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID });
const chain = celoAlfajoresTestnet;

<ConnectButton client={client} accountAbstraction={{ chain, sponsorGas: false }} />
```

# üõ°Ô∏è Admin Operations & Support Playbook

This section is the definitive guide for administrators and support teams responsible for the ongoing health, availability, and operational excellence of the Washika DAO platform. It replaces any previous decommissioning or sunset procedures. Use this playbook to monitor, troubleshoot, maintain, and continuously improve the application in production. All procedures here are designed for continuity, resilience, and smooth handover between teams.

## Purpose
This section ensures the app remains healthy, available, and easy to support for future teams.

## Monitoring & Debugging

A robust monitoring and debugging strategy is essential for operational excellence. Use the following tools and practices to ensure the platform remains healthy and issues are detected early:

### Coolify
- **Dashboard Monitoring:** Use the Coolify dashboard to monitor container health, resource usage (CPU, memory), and deployment status.
- **Alerts:** Configure Coolify to send alerts for failed deployments, unhealthy containers, or resource exhaustion.
- **Logs:** Access real-time and historical logs for each service directly from the Coolify UI.

### Docker
- **Container Health:**
  - List running containers: `docker ps`
  - Inspect container health: `docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container_id>`
  - View logs: `docker logs <container_id>`
- **Resource Usage:**
  - Monitor resource usage: `docker stats`
- **Restart/Recovery:**
  - Restart a container: `docker restart <container_id>`
  - Remove a failed container: `docker rm <container_id>`

### Nginx
- **Access Logs:**
  - View access logs: `docker exec -it <nginx_container> tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log`
- **Error Logs:**
  - View error logs: `docker exec -it <nginx_container> tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
- **Config Test:**
  - Test config: `docker exec -it <nginx_container> nginx -t`
- **Reload Config:**
  - Reload: `docker exec -it <nginx_container> nginx -s reload`

### Application Health Checks
- **HTTP Health Endpoints:**
  - Ensure `/health` or `/status` endpoints are available and monitored (add to backend if not present).
- **Automated Uptime Monitoring:**
  - Use external services (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom) to monitor public endpoints and alert on downtime.

### Analytics & User Flow
- **Analytics Integration:**
  - Use Google Analytics, Plausible, or similar to track user flows, drop-offs, and errors.
- **Error Tracking:**
  - Integrate Sentry or similar for frontend and backend error tracking.
- **Custom Events:**
  - Track key actions (DAO creation, proposal voting, multisig execution) for business insights.

### Proactive Monitoring
- **Set up alerting for:**
  - High error rates
  - Slow response times
  - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)
  - SSL certificate expiry
- **Regularly review logs and analytics dashboards.**
- **Schedule periodic health reviews and incident response drills.**

  - `ss -tuln` or `netstat -tuln`
- **Check disk usage:**
  - `df -h`
- **Check memory usage:**
  - `free -h`
- **Check CPU load:**
  - `top` or `htop`
- **Check SSL certificate expiry:**
  - `openssl s_client -connect washikadao.xyz:443 -servername washikadao.xyz | openssl x509 -noout -dates`

### Troubleshooting
- **Find container by name:**
  - `docker ps | grep <name>`
- **Check container exit code:**
  - `docker inspect <container_id> --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}'`
- **View recent system logs:**
  - `journalctl -xe` (Linux systems with systemd)
- **Check for failed services:**
  - `systemctl --failed`

## Incident Response

A clear, repeatable incident response process ensures rapid recovery and transparent communication. Use the following steps and templates when responding to incidents:

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Detection**
   - Monitor alerts from Coolify, analytics, or uptime monitoring.
   - Confirm the incident by checking logs, dashboards, and health endpoints.
2. **Classification**
   - Assess severity (Critical, Major, Minor) based on user/business impact.
3. **Initial Response**
   - Assign an incident lead.
   - Notify the team via preferred channel (Slack, email, etc.).
   - Acknowledge receipt to stakeholders.
4. **Containment & Mitigation**
   - Stop further damage (e.g., restart services, block malicious traffic).
   - Apply hotfixes or roll back to a stable version if needed.
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate logs, metrics, and recent changes.
   - Document findings in the incident log.
6. **Resolution & Recovery**
   - Restore full service.
   - Monitor for recurrence.
7. **Communication**
   - Update stakeholders on status and resolution.
   - Document the incident, actions taken, and lessons learned.
8. **Postmortem**
   - Hold a review meeting if severity warrants.
   - Update documentation and playbooks as needed.

### Escalation Matrix
| Severity   | Who to Notify                | Response Time | Escalation Path                |
|------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Critical   | All admins, project lead     | 15 min        | Escalate to domain owner/CTO   |
| Major      | On-call admin, project lead  | 1 hour        | Escalate to senior engineer    |
| Minor      | On-call admin                | 4 hours       | Escalate if unresolved in 24h  |

### Communication Templates

graph TD;
  User["User (Browser)"] -->|HTTP/HTTPS| Frontend["React/Vite App"]
  Frontend -->|REST| Backend["Backend API (Node/Remix/Express)"]
  Frontend -->|Wallet/Thirdweb| Blockchain["Smart Contracts (Celo)"]
  Backend -->|RPC/SDK| Blockchain
```

## Data Flow
- **User** interacts with the React app via browser.
- **Frontend** fetches data from the backend and interacts with blockchain via Thirdweb.
- **Backend** (future: will own all contract logic) exposes REST APIs for DAO, multisig, and proposal management.
- **Smart Contracts** enforce DAO rules, multisig, and proposals on-chain.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Frontend-first contract calls** for rapid prototyping and UX feedback.
- **Migration to backend-driven contract orchestration** for security, auditability, and consistency.
- **Remix adoption** for unified frontend/backend, SSR, and streamlined deployment.
